# Laplace-Equation-in-1D

The Laplace equation ($\nabla^2 \phi = 0$) is a second-order partial differential equation fundamental in various fields of science and engineering. It describes the behavior of scalar fields such as electric potential, fluid flow, and temperature distribution in steady-state conditions. Solutions to the Laplace equation, called harmonic functions, are essential in potential theory and have applications in physics, engineering, and mathematics.
